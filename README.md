Planning repository with wireframeing and similar documentation for The Reginas team (Project 3)

Project 3 Idea | Work Well App

Teams often have communication issues on projects from assignment to completion.
Our app Work Well, will take the mystery out of the project updates and errors that team members run into or when they have added to a project.

User stories

As a user, I need to be able to check off Task Progress
As a user, I need to submit project Update for the Log page (form)
As a user, I need to be able to log in to the app/project details
As a user, I would like to see who submitted a project Update

Stretch Goals:
As a user, I would like to schedule my availability (calendar)
As a user, I would like to be logged out after 15 mins of inactivity
As a user, I would like to see a live chat feature in the app

MVP Goals:
Show your activity status; green = on site; yellow = standing by; red = away
Create a chat function
I want to be able to invite members
